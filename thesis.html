                    For my undergraduate thesis, a year-long research project I completed as part of my Sociology degree, I wanted to learn something about the Bay Area. As part of the research for my undergraduate thesis, I wanted to use census data to explore how the federal government's
                    redlining policies have shaped the racial geography of the Bay Area, and in turn how they might be shaping the ongoing gentrification 
                    and displacement facing Bay Area residents living in communities of color. 
                    Working with ArcGIS, some very crude Python, and several decades of US Census data,
                    I was able to create the following map to help explore WHERE racial change, and gentrification, was taking place in the East Bay.
                    To do this, I used population data for individual census tracts and the historical "redlining" tracts to make the map below. 
                    NOT exhaustive---some limitations are mentioned below, but only data for black and white residents in graphed.

                    This is a map of each census tract recorded in the 2022 census, for all but 3 of the nine Bay Area counties.*
                    For each tract, this map contains a layer representing the population of Black residents, of white residents,
                    and the change in overall occupancy for Black and white residents over the last 20 years. To activate a layer, 
                    select one from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner of the map and once a layer is active, each tract can be clicked
                    to bring up the data corresponding to that layer.

                    The goal with each of these layers is to find a way to visually look for 'hotspots' of racial change--specific neighborhoods in the East Bay that 
                    are seeing disproportionately large influxes of white people. Before I had even begun getting together census data, my hunch was that neighborhoods in 
                    South Berkeley and West Oakland would be the most dramatically "whitened" neighborhoods. Zooming out to see the entire map reveals that not only are Temescal, Longfellow, and West Oakland/The Bottoms 
                    the most "whitened" neighborhoods in the East Bay, but the West Oakland and North Oakland/South Berkeley tracts have seen THE largest increases in white residency.

                <p>
                    Although my 'hypothesis' was that these neighborhoods, places that I think of as gentrifying due to the large amount of development projects and cultural/economic change taking place within them, 
                    would be highlighted when looking at racial change, I was really surprised to see just how dramatically different these few
                    neighborhoods in the East Bay were from the rest of the Bay Area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    surprises:
                    - white people were decreasing almost everywhere
                        - especially significant, because places where white people are increasing is extra unusual
                    - places like the mission, sf had much less change than I thought
                    - the central east bay is SO gentrified
                </p>
                <p>
                    This map also has shapefile data for the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) census tract appraisals, the federal organization that--literally--put redlining on the map.
                    Going into the HOLC tracts is a little too deep for this write up, but reading through the HOLC's tract appraisals makes it clear that the HOLC used explicitly antiblack and anti-asian
                    criteria to devalue nonwhite neighborhoods.

                    Limitations of the data & this approach
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My process working with Census data, as well as the US Census itself, has some really important limitations when it comes to
                    understanding racial identity. One, the US census continues to underrepresent nonwhite residents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to problems inherent to the US Census and attempts to statistically record racial identity, this is not a map of gentrification.
                    "Gentrification," a term first coined in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass 
                    Looking for gentrification solely through the lens of white and Black populations completely misses the A) dozens of other groups of people who do not fall into literal 
                    "Black" and "white" racial groups and B) the ways that groups of Black and white residents are further divided by class. 
                    Ruth Glass was originally studying was one class of white people displacing another, a process which won't show up in a limited race-only analysis like this and would instead
                    require looking at other class markers, maybe income, property value, education level, health, to be visualized. In the exact same way, gentrification occuring from one
                    socioeconic class of ANY nonwhite person also can't be visualized using these maps.

                </p>
                <h2>
                    The good & the bad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With that said, I think this approach to exploring gentrification is still a powerful way of visualizing
                    the magnitude of displacement.
                    Areas highlighted by these maps that have very rapid racial change, specifically 'whitening,' really are also areas
                    that are gentrifying in the East Bay. Although Glass's original use of the term was centered around economic class,
                    cultural, racial, and economic change are ALL contributing aspects of gentrification, and the fact that class change and rapid housing cost inflation
                    is so closely coupled with the racial changes shown above is further evidence of how deeply entangled the Bay Area's housing market is with racial segregation.
                    Though they cannot fully capture who and where is involved with gentrification, maps of racial change like these do a good job
                    of highlighting the racialized, antiblack effects gentrification brings AND highlighting how localized these affects are to specific neighborhoods.
                    Although fundamentally limited in scope, looking at gentrification purely as a racial process can help identify
                    areas where cultural change is most extreme.
