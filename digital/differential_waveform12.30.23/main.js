/*
Idea is to have a 2D line grow based on the differential growth automata process:
https://www.kaspar.wtf/blog/differential-growth
Then feed this line into a synthesizer as a wave (or wavetable)
This line should ALSO be able to be swept thru using a slider or wavetable slide or something like that

goal would be to have a cool way of adding harmonics/experimenting with differential shapes
