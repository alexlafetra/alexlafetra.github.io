                Hello! I'm an art handler and installer living and working throughout the Bay Area. I
                install 2D and sculptural work for gallery shows and private homes, I pack work for transportation,
            I paint walls, and I build pedestals/display hardware for exhibitition spaces.

            I've been working as an art installer in the Bay Area since 2019.
            I've been installing work in the Bay Area since 2019, right at the beginning of the 2019 pandemic.
            For the past 4 years I've been installing art for galleries in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the hamptons, Chicago, and the SF Bay Area.

            <p>In 2023 I graduated from Wesleyan University, where I studied Biology 
            and Sociology, but also focused on painting and illustration. Since graduating, I mostly work freelance for local galleries in the East Bay and San Francisco where I grew up.
            You can see more of me, my work, and some of my projects at my <a href = "https://alexlafetra.github.io/">site</a>.
            Contact me with any questions or installation requests!
