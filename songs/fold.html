<!-- there's something on the floor again darling
everything got sticky it only took a year
i'm trying to clean it up again only
to find it's my hands making things 

it's like you're all talking at the same time

things that push you around in life that you can't always see
like love bringing you to someone

entered a suicide pact
with the part of our hearts that makes us strong
i know i need to give it up honey
i know i can't take it where i'm going -->

<!-- what i see when i close my eyes -->

confirmation bias killer
looking for someone to get in my way
i just let the bullet fly out
squeeze my eyes and let it ricochet

<!-- Break  -->

i'm in the pavement
try to hit the ground smiling
i'm in the moment
but i'm trying to hold it at the same time

i'm on the pavement
said i hit the ground smiling
i'm in the moment
i think i'll lose it one more time
<!-- dive in the ocean of sweat in my bed -->

<!-- Break -->

someone else is coming inside
singing "i can't understand a word
when you're all talking at the same time"

so give a little force field darling
i need a little push to start my day
vertebral contact 
i mouth a little dust devil heartburn
pick me up and pull me sideways

you're in the handshake
send little earthquakes up my spine
what's in the moment
i know i start to open up to find

<!-- it's just so uneasy sometimes
feeling the wind sweep my heart to the side -->
