<!-- confirmation bias killer
looking for something to get in your way
just let the bullet fly out
squeeze your eyes and let it ricochet

someone else comes inside
saying "i can't understand a word
when you're all talking at the same time"

you're in the handshake
send a little earthquake up my spine
under the table

i get so judgemental
started with myself, but then i got so good
at finding what's missing
folding it up, without saying a word

take it off one side at a time
i'm looking and seeing nothing but a tan line

i'm seeing you constantly
getting so up and and then i get so down

i'm in the pavement
said i hit the ground smiling
//ailing and accepting that there's something funny and okay about failing
so sorry i'm trying
kill myself without dying
by my own hand

-->

pulling on my band-aid baby
take it off i don't mind

curling up in my hand
it's not
an easy shape
all of the time

where is that knife in my side
that kept me standing so straight all the time


i'm on the pavement
think i hit the ground smiling
for just a moment
frozen before my forehead hit 

caught in the moment
try to not to hold it

can you pull me out instantly
gut me like a fish/that you want to eat
clean me out fill me up i can become almost anything

would that work for you?
i'm booked with work except for sunday afternoon
baby baby is there time enough to make love

i'd like to be close to you
i like to keep my distance too
hiding in your contradictions love
imagining that you make  sense from above


the way you pull me out suddenly
like a sock caught in itself
like a 

accepting that i will fail
at so many things that i want from
this
place is so hard and soft at the same time


ballad-y like that charlie song
like a list of confessions about insecurities
folding like crumpling yourself up
way of hiding yourself, way of throwing yourself away
throwing away is also like escaping

so come won't you come my way (this is kind of a departure from the rest of the tone of the verse)
even though i can't understand the words
when we're both talking at the same time

it cuts so constantly

i think about it constantly
to be honest i haven't
said a word

i'm on the pavement
think i hit the ground smiling
for just a moment
frozen before my forehead hit
