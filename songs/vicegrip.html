 <!-- intro -->
 i'm in over my head
 i can feel the water line
 dancing at my lips uh

 you just took it in
 held it for a second
 like a levee breaking in (caving?)
 <!-- like a levee slowly caving in -->

 <!-- making me laugh
 thinking about the dishes
 buried in your bedsheets  -->

 always so weird to see
 all the dishes in your bedsheets

 but still a little space for me
 between the sex toys and magazines

 <!-- chorus bit -->
 that went over my head
 but it's coming out my mouth
 just the same anyway

 i'm feeling so uneasy again
 they're dancing all around me
 there's flowers everywhere

 <!-- bridge -->

 that went over my head
 but i wanna be funny
 so i'm saying it anyway

 burning down our house again
 i read on wikipedia
 that it's stolen anyway

 i know you just let him in
 and now he's scratching at the door
 because he doesn't know how to say
