 i'm in over my head
 glowing every now and then i get a little better i
 it's so uneasy again
 you come over
 to flowers everywhere

 she's on and off again

 i'm in over my head
 i can feel the water line dancing at my lips

 i can feel the water line
 dancing at my lips i
 then you just took it in
 held it for a second like a-

 that went over my head
 but it's coming out my mouth
 just the same anyway

 we're not speaking again
 the silence gets me down
 and hooks me like a cigarette
