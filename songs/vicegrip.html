i'm in over my head
i can feel the water line
dancing at my lips i
spend the day playing pretend
affecting personalities that i thought i wanted

<!-- like you're coming home after a day, returning to being more internal -->

i'm a little over my head
but i'm not holding my breath
please don't tell me
if it's gonna kill me, baby
you only get what you give

<!-- feeling looser -->

synchronized in the back of your pocket now it's
too soon but too late to really stop it



shine bright like LEDs
promise me baby is this what you need
you work on putting holes in all your angels, babe
just to get a tight grip when you grab their wings

<!-- chorus -->

that went alittle over over my head
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway
i wanna be the kind that breaks all at once
but i'm gettin kinda worried i just fall apart slowly
 
push it into my head
until the filament gets thin and starts burning

sorry, was that not what you said?
i cough a little 

facetime
all the time i'm
pavloved to my phone
it's
so funny
but i'm not laughing
busy crawling on the sim
busy falling for my ring tone

instagram
without a plan
recklessly
anxiety
it's
so funny
but i'm not laughing
busy scrolling through my friends
busy calling on my cell phone

that went over my head
but it's comin out my mouth
just the same anyway
i wanna be the kind that breaks all at once
but i'm gettin kinda worried i just fall apart slowly
