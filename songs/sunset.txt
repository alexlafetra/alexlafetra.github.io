you live in the sunset
so you don't get burned much
but baby when you doooo
you know you like to lick the wouuund

trying hasn’t worked yet
depending what you heart wants
sometimes i don’t know how to ask just
lay me in the winter grass

walking to the liquor store
abandoned what i thought it was
living gently in my phone you’re
collecting like a stone 
just

caught up in costumes
i’m stuck
o my gooood
i 
hope i outgrow it
but i just
might not

[interlude]

i sound so stupid
asking you about your man
marqui wears a smile
i've got people in the aisle


i direct in my head
movies that never leave the set

movies i don't even watch (movies that never leave the screen)


head until i get sick i just
crush like a
bug sometimes
curled like we're snakes
remember when we kissed outside your parents


crushin
love often
in the morning
baby you still blossom

moving hasn’t  gotten old

touching all the ones you love
kissing photos of things you want
i’m 

crying till you feel sick
the summers always half done
break like the moon like a plastic baaag
like an egg against the frying pan
