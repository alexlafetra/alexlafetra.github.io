play too precious on the ride (ride home)
gracious presence imma take my time
come and tell me what you like
i'm gonna paint the walls

barefoot on the kitchen tile (baby said)
on the phone said look me in my eyes (dirty all the time?)
purple just below the thigh
who's gonna break my fall - left the city just in time
