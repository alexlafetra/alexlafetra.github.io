    lemme be your aspirin<br>
    i wanna drive us off the map i wanna dance with you on the sun<br>
</p>
<p>
    I look at you like a dog babe
    <!-- the way it does before it misbehaves -->
    the way it's not sure if it's misbehaved

    you can only taste it if it's walking away i guess it
    only seems fair to you to pick up the pace
</p>

    i was<br>
    trying hard not to break mine i was<br>
    running away from a feeling<br>
    i was<br>
</p>
<p class = "verse">
    and i've been running through the country<br>
    you left me feeling so hungry<br>
    for<br>
    something i can give to myself that can't get taken away<br>
