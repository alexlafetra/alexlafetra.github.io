 -->



 all your life you've been falling
 slowly without really moving
 but every 
 body all around you saying
 ohhhhh
 but you're flying so good

 floating down between the houses
 the people look just like little aspirins
 but you don't feel anything until
 you touch
 the ground babe

 everyones taking off their costumes
 every, one, except for me and you
 maybe you're still hiding
 or maybe you just never
 put
 one on babe

 <!-- because they never put one on you -->
 <!-- i really like oh superman by laurie anderson because it mixes personal political and non sequiturs so well -->

 jonathan soaks up the daylight
 while
 meredith learns to speak what's on her mind
 an engine
 burns we are so innocent we don't even feel that
 bad babe

 while we were sitting in your day light
 trying so hard
 not to peel the rind
 that
 surrounded all the flesh of what you dreamt in your head

 he wouldn't steal you from your houses
 he wouldn't
 crush you under bricks and conduits
 except if
 it really seemed like he needed
 
 <!-- like chasing nationalism/looking for evidence of american myths -->
 while i've been running through the country
 she's been
 counting all the missiles launching
 and i've been
 running from imaginary goals that i can't begin
 <!-- ducking in and out of dirty laundry -->

 while you were living in your high rise
 trying to look good while you killed the time

 he's staring at it like a dog babe
 the way it
 the way it does after it misbehaves maybe
 he knows he's only in control because the world is
 in chaos anyway

 i think love burns last 

 <!-- you need to use absolute force so people don't realize how weak you are (or your right to authority is) -->
 now barking at you like he's gonna bite
 he's stuck on his chain because cause
 his only power is that he can really fights
 so the
 rope keeping him tied down keeps him tied to his teeth

 now barking at you like he's on a chain
 the way he
 the way he does to seem brave
 secretly
 hoping that you leave him tied
 secretly wishing to be back inside

  <!-- this needs a chorus to break it up -->

  so if you're gonna gonna come back baby
  make sure you do it before i change
 

 the big fish eat the little ones
 and beg for
 forgiveness before they're even done
 i make a
 meme on my phone and worry that it's too
 political babe

 and finally ask for forgiveness
 from behind a gun
 i guess we
 can't keep you on the hook for what you did

 nevermind all the repeats
 never
 lock eyes with the ghosts of the things we don't read



 sometimes
 he still watches you
 on his phone without the volume
 studying
 the curve of your mouth so he can recognize
 it when he finds it again
 but

 so did you walk away from omelas
 or did you
 talk about it until you just forgot
 does it matter if there was a moment where you wanted to do
 the right thing ahh
