 -->

 all your life you've been falling
 slowly without really moving
 all the
 people in the little houses look up to tell you
 that you're flying so well
 and

 everyone takes off their costumes
 everyone that is, except for me and you
 i don't know
 but 
 i don't remember you 
 ever
 putting one
 on babe

 <!-- because they never put one on you -->
 <!-- i really like oh superman by laurie anderson because it mixes personal political and non sequiturs so well -->

 while you were sitting in your day light
 trying so hard
 not to peel the rind
 that
 surrounded all the flesh of what you dreamt in your head

 <!-- like chasing nationalism/looking for evidence of american myths -->
 well i've been running through the country
 chasing missiles i hear rockets launching

 well he was
 he was running thru the country
 ducking in and out his dirty laundry
 beating
 through the cold morning breath that he was doing alright

 he stares at you like a dog babe
 the way it
 the way it does after it misbehaves maybe
 if everyone is telling you it's fine
 you're the one
 who's going crazy

 the big fish eat the little ones
 and finally ask for forgiveness
 from behind a gun
 i guess we
 can't keep you on the hook for what you did

 nevermind all the repeats
 never
 lock eyes with the ghosts of the things we don't read

 while we were sitting in the day light
 you were
 trying hard to crack 
 i was
 while most were hard not to break mine
 you know my
 phone can push me off a cliff so easily

 you've been running through the country
 ducking
 in and out of dirty laundry
 you spend
 all your money filling up your eyes
 so that it looks like every
 one loves you babe
