are you coming through
back to town
back to me

have you been better sincewe spoke last

just checking in
i think i might be checking out
i've been looking for a new place
like i said i would

are you coming to
the last
place in my head
still burning

coughing up until i get you out

did you change tactics
well i have since the last time
i've been giving out my hand so freely
but never squeezing tight
