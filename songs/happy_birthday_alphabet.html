    <!-- i want to write about how i feel about zella
    how i wish i could've done something to make her happy, or feel better, or love her life more
    and how it hurt so bad baby to see you like that
    it really scared me, and made me feel alone like you weren't worried but i was
 -->

 this feels like i'm pointing out some flaw
 or offering some critique of who you are
 

 kind of feeling inspired by grace ives and "natasha" by rufus wainwright
