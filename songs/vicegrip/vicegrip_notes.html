<!-- u might have to throw a lot away to move forward -->
 <!-- let go of all the structure and write the song from scratch, all the elements u have are good but u need to have a song to hold them together -->
//relisten to the 2.17.24 version, it's better
//why do rough demos sound so much better sometime?

i'm in over my head
i can feel the water line
dancing at my lips i
<!-- //not knowing how to be close to ppl, how to be yourself -->
spend some time playing pretend
becoming personalities that i thought i wanted

i'm alone on and off again
i don't know if it's better 


that went over over my head
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway

<!-- i'm not feeling sad for myself
but it hurt my hands a bit from pressing on the pane -->

<!-- can't stop thinking bout you again -->
breaking through the 
<!-- separating but coming back together -->
b b but the way you treat me baby h-hooks me like a cigarette

push it into my head
i'm so convinced
there's nothing i can do i

i'm stubborn when it comes to the end
i'm brittle when i'm caught
right inside your vice grips

<!-- i'm so convinced 
there's nothing i can do i
i guess i guess you're winning again
crush back baby they've got you in their vice grips -->

//more vice grips verses, and then a break (kind of the chorus is all the vice grip metaphors)


<!-- i can't believe i didn't realize i was rejected -->
you didn't care enough to tell me i'm rejected
i'm hurting from 

using just your thumb and the
movement in your fingertips it
are you feeling useless again?
just like spring turns to summer
and holds you in its vice grips

she's on and off again 

<!-- sometimes you watch it slip through right your fingertips -->

but you won't back down
i just 

<!-- chorus? -->
that went over my head (aouuu)
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway
feeling so uneasy again
<!-- on the right track lately just
offset by a few steps -->
your filament can get thin enough to start burning

<!-- Pause -->

i'm in over my head
but i only get scared when i have to hold my breath in? (holding breath/feeling like you need to endure w/o struggling)

tongue tied
can't lie
i see
thru you again

that went into my head
that last one i caught right between my eyes but
but i'm keeping it there
gently split between the feelings  

that went into my head
the last one got me right between my lips
we trade a little honesty then
held us for a second like a blanket made of vice grips

that went over my head
i can feel the water line
dancing at my lips i
then you just took it in
held it for a second like a-

that went over my head
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway

we're not speaking again
the silence gets me down
and hooks me like a cigarette
