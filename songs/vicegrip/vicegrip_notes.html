i'm in over my head
i can feel the water line
dancing at my lips i
spend the day playing pretend
affecting personalities that i thought i wanted

i'm a little over my head
but i'm not holding my breath
please don't tell me
if it's gonna kill me, baby
only get what i give  

<!-- i think i'm doing it again
i hold my breath because i 
A little over my head --> which is where you want to be, a little bit of self harm
<!-- being stuck at home, feeling like i'm waiting for something to change -->
realize i'm holding my breath
(everyone's invited) 
but i'm staying home with you instead -->

drunk when we call
<!-- holding hands in perfect circles
holding nothing at all -->
shine bright like LEDs
in your dreams you've got me on my knees
while
watching you cut holes in all your angels babe
so that you get a good grip when you grab their wings

<!-- chorus -->

that went alittle over over my head
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway
i wanna be the kind that breaks all at once
but i'm gettin kinda worried i just fall apart slowly
 
push it into my head
until the filament gets thin and starts burning
take a risk and broke my heart again


<!-- i watch it fly overhead
but i don't let it show i noticed
i don't act as though it's anything
the first shot broke your heart all at once
on the second hit baby it peeled apart slowly -->

two shots and i'm calling again
it's like the filament stretched thin and started burning
acted like you knew what u said
until the filament stretched thin and started burning
<!-- ugh -->
push it into my head
i'm so convinced
there's nothing i can do i

<!-- can handle shit breaking all at once -->
<!-- but i can't accept that things would peel apart slowly -->

facetime
all the time i'm
pavloved to my phone
it's
so funny
but i'm not laughing
busy crawling on the sim
busy falling for my ring tone

instagram
without a plan
recklessly
anxiety
it's
so funny
but i'm not laughing
busy scrolling through my friends
busy calling on my cell phone

that went over my head
but it's comin out my mouth
just the same anyway
can't stop thinking bout you again
the way you treat me baby
hooked me like a cigarette
