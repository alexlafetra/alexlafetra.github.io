<!-- u might have to throw a lot away to move forward -->
 <!-- let go of all the structure and write the song from scratch, all the elements u have are good but u need to have a song to hold them together -->
//relisten to the 2.17.24 version, it's better
//why do rough demos sound so much better sometime?

i'm in over my head
i can feel the water line
dancing at my lips i
<!-- //not knowing how to be close to ppl, how to be yourself -->
<!-- spend some time playing pretend -->
got so caught in playing pretend
becoming personalities that i thought i wanted

i want it badly but just
not in the right way baby
i'm deleting it again
just to click on the spot where it was

<!-- saying anything to please you -->
that went over over my head
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway

deleting instagram again
but i'm going on safari just the same anyway

speaking just to please you i guess it
be comes like second nature

<!-- i'm not feeling sad for myself
but it hurt my hands a bit from pressing on the pane -->

<!-- can't stop thinking bout you again -->
breaking through the 
lately i'm feeling ___
lately been pulling right to the thread
<!-- separating but coming back together -->
b b but the way you treat me baby h-hooks me like a cigarette

push it into my head
i'm so convinced
there's nothing i can do i


<!-- i'm so convinced 
there's nothing i can do i
i guess i guess you're winning again
crush back baby they've got you in their vice grips -->


<!-- i think prob remove this? it's a tangent -->
facetime
-ing all the time i'm
pavloved to my phone it's
so funny but i'm not laughing
busy crawling on the sim
busy falling for my ring tone

//more vice grips verses, and then a break (kind of the chorus is all the vice grip metaphors)


<!-- i can't believe i didn't realize i was rejected -->
you didn't care enough to tell me i'm rejected
i'm hurting from 

using just your thumb and the
movement in your fingertips it
are you feeling useless again?
just like spring turns to summer
and holds you in its vice grips

she's on and off again 

<!-- sometimes you watch it slip through right your fingertips -->

but you won't back down
i just 

<!-- chorus? -->
that went over my head (aouuu)
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway
feeling so uneasy again
<!-- on the right track lately just
offset by a few steps -->
your filament can get thin enough to start burning

<!-- Pause -->

i'm in over my head
but i only get scared when i have to hold my breath in? (holding breath/feeling like you need to endure w/o struggling)

tongue tied
can't lie
i see
thru you again

that went into my head
that last one i caught right between my eyes but
but i'm keeping it there
gently split between the feelings  

that went into my head
the last one got me right between my lips
we trade a little honesty then
held us for a second like a blanket made of vice grips

that went over my head
i can feel the water line
dancing at my lips i
then you just took it in
held it for a second like a-

that went over my head
but it's coming out my mouth
just the same anyway

we're not speaking again
the silence gets me down
and hooks me like a cigarette
