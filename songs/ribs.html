<!-- 
    I like how sunny&gabe's lyrics are kind of aggy, like they're always egging someone on
    or getting on them about something they're insecure about. 
    It's more like...playful. And a little more interesting bc there're a lot of emotions going
    on.

    F				Bb7a9<br>
    hung up on the fence<br>
    Fmaj7a9	Bbmaj7. <br>
    i’m stuck won’t you get me <br>
    down pretty baby <br>
    <br>
    falling in love<br>
    trick me an addiction<br>
    give me a method to quit em<br>
    <br>

<!-- need to explain a little more about the sitch -->


    now your just<br>
    just stuck in the frame<br>
    of her bedroom window<br>
    watching it unfold<br>
    (ew)<br>
    <br>
    rolling my eyes<br>
    the pool was still standing but<br>
    too shallow to drown in<br>
    <br>

    <span class = "label">chorus</span>
    <br>
    stuck on the fence<br>
    right where you left me<br>
    pick me up pretty baby<br>
    <br>
    when we kisssed<br>
    tastes like splitting a secret<br>
    you don't wanna keep it but it's<br>
    <br>
    stuck to your ribs <br>
    you can mold it like play doh or you could just slowly let go<br>
    <br>

    snuck out in the niiight<br>
    if you're looking for closure<br>
    then just pull the car over but ya<br>
    <br>
    speeding again<br>
    you're driving to fast<br>
    <br>
    sweet to the tooth (00uuth)<br>
    and i’m breaking beside her<br>
    while i’m laughing through tears<br>
    with my back on the roof<br>
    <br>
    the thought is caught in my head<br>
    please help me get it out<br>
    won’t you open up my mouth<br>
    <br>
