    I like how sunny&gabe's lyrics are kind of aggy, like they're always egging someone on
    or getting on them about something they're insecure about. 
    It's more like...playful. And a little more interesting bc there're a lot of emotions going
    on.

    F				Bb7a9
    stuck on the fence
    Fmaj7a9	Bbmaj7. 
    i’m hung up won’t you get me 
    down pretty baby ahhh
    
    just stuck in the frame
    of the bedroom window
    watching it unfold
    (ew)

    <!-- chorus -->
    baby baby baby baby maybe
    if things we're different
        

    rolling my eyes
    the pool is still standing but
    too shallow to drown in
    
    and when we kisssed
    taste like splitting secrets
    that you don't wanna keep but it

    so stuck on the fence
    right where you left me
    pick me up pretty baby
    
    gets stuck to the ribs 
    i can mold it like play doh but i can't really let go
