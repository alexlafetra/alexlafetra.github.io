<!-- it doesn't have to be so sad! or down, your lyrics don't need to confess but they do need to be honest -->

<!-- intro -->
i'm in the cut
holding my name half empty
all of my words
stuck
like pits in cherries  

b b b bloom like a flower
that shit can cut like ice cream
drip on your wrist
smoke me like sweetened ligh tning
she- [cut]

i'm just
falling
without 
watching  

my baby holds me under her tongue
dissolving like jeans undone 

i'm done, i'm stuck, i'm stuck, i'm stuck i'm stuck


something something
pressing you arms against me
holding me close
just
like banks and pennies

laugh in my throat
you catch me like a back brace
L17 twist up on each of our first dates
she
looks at me i see mysef start sinking
it happens so fast so fast so fast so fast i'm

falling
are you
waiting
asking
ah la
of love la la
