<!-- it doesn't have to be so sad! or down, your lyrics don't need to confess but they do need to be honest -->

<!-- intro -->
i'm in the cut
holding my name half empty
all of my words
stuck
like pits in cherries  

b b b bloom like a flower
that shit can cut like ice cream
drip on your wrist
smoke me like sweetened ligh tning
she- [cut]

<!-- nervous at a party? or nervous while waiting? or nervous in conversation? -->
b b b bloom like a flower
i met you in the city

<!-- my nerves won't let me
talk to you slow it's like i'm

i'm done, i'm stuck, i'm stuck, i'm stuck i'm stuck

<!-- my baby holds me under her tongue -->
lately i've been so under your tongue
feel i'm dissolving without coming undone
want to fall so hard

<!-- sometimes you lick your lips
while
melting sugar cubes -->

<!-- sometimes i'm licking lips
sometimes i'm sugarcube

sometimes your powerless
costuming bulletproof
sometimes you're bulletproof -->

<!-- they want you powerless
look what it does to you -->

laugh in my throat
you catch me like a back brace
Thoracic T3 twist up on each of our first dates
sometimes it
feels like i'm speaking
through a TP tube
and then at the same time i feel so so so see through
