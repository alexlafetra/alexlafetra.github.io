i'm a liar in this way
i can't stop talking when we have nothing to say
in a restauraunt in a city in the glass
i see us being watched by everyone we pass

firestarter
but a guy was in the way
you went to burn an empty house but turns out they
all got evicted from the city in the sun
now they're living in the house you burned for fun 

cheek kisser
rent is high and people sad
there was another loophole in the housing act 
tongue toucher
had to move your grandpa's bed 
into his garage so he could afford the rent

i'm a liar in this one way
i don't recall why was it so important to say
i like the warmth that comes shining off your eyelids
when you wrinkle as you're laughing at what you did

lava flow-er
grow a flower in your teeth
from the poppy seed you were chewing at the beach
everyone was too polite to point it out
now they all can't stop looking in your mouth
magnetizer
get stuck searching for what's new
ended getting choked up on something in plain view
it took three years to get over him
and honestly it comes and goes it just depends

hopscotcher 
scratched your knee and couldn't run
the scar tissue still glitters in the sun
small reminders gather up across your skin
sometimes you look down at the mark and you still feel it

<!-- funky demon
put the angel in the bag
keep your head down don't get dea d before you've had
the taste you needed though you were never really asked
what it was you wanted with the goose you tried to catch -->

new york poet
and your rhymes are kind of mean
secretely they're all about your self esteem
keep a copy of your pictures on a thumb drive
you dangle it off brooklyn bridge it helps you feel alive

polarizer 
i'm  a liar in this one way
i try to think of something that can make the moment stay
