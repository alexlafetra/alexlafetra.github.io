<!-- abt idealizing   -->
 <!-- connecting the shine in animal eyes to the shine of a pearl -- formed as a denfense mechanism against sand? -->

i'm on it
cheek cut on another diamond 
still wet like i've been crying
face hot like i'm one you're kissing

i got it
two wings beat at different times
laugh around in bed
in the light in your eyes
in the cellphone flash
look like mother pearl
i got my

eyes on it
before you got too close
i was running away i 

i promise 
hold my hand but just for balance 
some times you need a challenge
i think love'll be the rock i'm pushing 

<!-- chorus  ? -->  

you're in it
cheek cut on another diamond
still wet like i've been crying
face hot like i'm one you're kissing

i'm on it
radiate like instant ramen
heart small enough to palm it
i think i feel it breaking

<!-- chorus -->
choking back the sand
my disappearing act
turning into pearls

choking on the beach sand
you're disappearing idols
into pearls

don't you ever feel that
look right at me but it's like
we're both alone

spitting up the beach sand
my dissasociated

i was swallowing grains
of sand won't you pull out
the pearls in me

all the sand i swallowed
turned into lacquer bulle

<!-- same cadence as the two wings part -->
trains spend their life on tracks 
do you do you do you do you really like it like that
your eyes catch the camera like they're mother pearl



<!-- i want it
can't sleep when i'm sleepin in your bed
heat through eyelids we look red
heart stopped when i saw you with him -->
