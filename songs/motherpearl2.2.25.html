<!-- abt idealizing   -->

i'm on it
cheek cut on another diamond 
still wet like i've been crying
face hot like i'm one you're kissing

i got it
two wings beat at different times
laugh around in bed
see the light i n your eyes
in the cellphone flash
look like mother pearl
i got my

eyes on it
before you got too close
i was running away i 

i promise 
hold my hand but just for balance
said you think i might make a good challenge
i think love'll be the rock i'm pushing 

<!-- chorus --> 
if you can't stop
if you can't stop baby, open
if you can't stop
if you can't stop baby, open

i got it
cheek cut on another diamond
still wet like i've been crying
face hot like i'm one you're kissing

i'm on it
radiate like instant ramen
heart small enough to palm it
i think i feel it breaking

<!-- chorus -->

<!-- same cadence as the two wings part -->
trains spend their life on tracks 
do you do you do you do you really like it like that
your eyes catch the camera like they're mother pearl



<!-- i want it
can't sleep when i'm sleepin in your bed
heat through eyelids we look red
heart stopped when i saw you with him -->
