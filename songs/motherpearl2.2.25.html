i'm on it
cheek cut on another diamond
still wet like i've been crying
face hot like i'm one you're kissing

i'm on it
two wings they beat in time
laugh around in bed
everything is fine
the cross of your eyes
shooting mother pearl

i got my
eyes on it
when i get too close it's
running away i

eyes on it

 
cheek cut on another diamond
still wet like i've been crying
face hot like i'm one you're kissing

i got it

radiate  like instant ramen
heart small enough to palm it
i think i feel it breaking



i'm in it

chase needle thru silk
as i write your name
in thread from the 



<!-- i want it
can't sleep when i'm sleepin in your bed
heat through eyelids we look red
heart stopped when i saw you with him -->
