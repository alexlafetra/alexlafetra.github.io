<!-- 
    I like how sunny&gabe's lyrics are kind of aggy, like they're always egging someone on
    or getting on them about something they're insecure about. 
    It's more like...playful. And a little more interesting bc there're a lot of emotions going
    on.

    <!-- think about a moment where you copied someone -->
    <!-- i copy people i don't even know, i do things sometimes that are just 'supposed' to be
    emblematic of a feeling or a moment and they don't fit how i feel. 

    -->
    <!-- risk averse
    
    why is it even bad to be risk averse? what happens if you live your life like someone
who can't lose anything?

why does rejection hurt so much?-->

<!-- you can't stop mirroring facial expressions and it bothers you
it's like you don't have your own feelings -->


<!-- from wikipedia "Betrayal" page:

The key difference between traditional posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
and betrayal trauma is that the former is historically seen as being caused 
primarily by fear, whereas betrayal trauma is a response to extreme anger. 
Fear and anger are the two sides to the fight-or-flight response, 
and as such are our strongest and most basic psychological emotions.[citation needed]

    <!-- la da da da
    i can almost taste it
    as the bus drives
    inches from the pavement

    how does she do that
    the way she talks so smoothly
    he takes a note of what he can
    but leaves feeling empty -->

        <!-- you love it
    you put it in a glass case baby
    in the oven
    you melt just like you're wax baby
    it's hard to tell when you're blowing hot air this heavy -->
    
    <!-- when you're desperate
    which happens these days all the time
    you copy quickly
    you treat your own heart so unkind -->

    <!-- bridge/second chorus -->

    <!-- first verse -->

    da da da da
    i can almost taste it
    the bitter feeling one more time
    when i see you coming

    i love it
    your face just like a gun kept in my
    back pocket
    kept so close but pointed at me
    <!-- i think it's mine but it's pointed at me -->

    <!-- uneasy feeling of control and betrayal -->

    <!-- first chorus  -->

    just because you cough it up
    doesn't mean you've had enough
    you just might need a moment to breaathe
    n if it just runs out your ribs
    then it's really not worth the sip
    but if it catches in your throat then maybe

    <!-- second verse -->
    <!-- this one is about noticing how you want to be liked in conversations with strangers -->

    so are you desperate/i can't tell
    it happens so often
    that all the things holding you shut
    suddenly start to open

    and i love it
    but i can't stand the way that i'm feeling
    i'm covered
    up with all the things that i'm thinking
    
    <!-- that everything which made you strong 
    suddenly starts to soften -->

    <!-- exposing vulnerability -->
    <!-- but also letting go of trying to control how other people see you -->

    <!-- happy and embracing something dangerous
    or at least out of your control -->
    and i love it
    your tongue tip cut on the way they see you
    while you're running
    just stop the blood but not the feeling

    and i love it
    your tongue cut on the way they see you
    walking
    away but always kept so near you

    and i love it
    your tongue cut but you won't stop asking
    hard questions
    hard to when you keep asking


    and i love it
    your tongue cut deep but you're still laughing
    hold me open
    what made you asking
    
    tongue gush blood and when they see you
    still running
    they take their time before they ask you --
    <!-- mr mr lonestar -->

    and we're covered 
    we can stop the blood but not the feeling

    and i love it
    i ask you some to slice my tongue on
    the moment

    and i love it
    start to talk but slice your tongue on
    the moment

    wings like yours are hard to come by

    and i love it
    my tongue cut on the thing you asked when
    we're laughing
    it plug the cut but can't stop the bleeding


    cut my tongue on what you ask when
    we're laughing
    it'll plug the cut but can't stop the bleeding
    it'll stop the blood but not the feeling

    <!-- and i love it
    my tongue i cut deep in mid sentence
    instantly
    just to make the words come clearly

    my tongue gets cut in mid sentence
    instantly
    blood makes it hard to keep pretending

    when i cut my tongue in mid sentence
    you're laughing
    you can stop the blood but not the feeling -->

    <!-- when you take a piece of what's inside me
    when you take a piece and jump the train tracks
    start running -->
    

    your face just like a gun kept in my
    back pocket
    kept so close but pointed at me


    <!-- need a little more -->

    mister mister lone star
    when you fell hard
    why did you decide to just keep falling ah ah
    did you find who made ya
    crumple up like paper
    ur blowin your nose with your own hat baby baby

    just because you cough it up
    doesn't mean you've had enough
    you just might need a moment to breaathe
    when the sun cuts through your fist
    you feel it open just a little bit
    but when it shines onto your face
    it drives you crazy

    <!-- repeat this for the verse 2 -->

    so are you happy i can't tell/it happens so often
    that everyone who wants you back really badly 

    so are you happy/i can't tell/it looks like you're dreaming
    that everyone who wants you back suddenly comes up 

    la da da da
    i can almost hold it
    the burning feeling in my heart
    when i see you laughing

    you fix things only for a time
    because everyone knows

    <!-- i can almost taste it -->
    i still can't stop chasing
    i think you tricked yourself again
    trying to fill a space up

    i see you standing in the rain i

    but i had to fill the space up <!--this line is faster-->
    <!-- to get good at faking -->

    
    the only lies that really count
    are the ones you tell yourself
    they find a way to fill your heart until it
    became to hard to fart?

    you call an ex to say you're breaking
    up again with yourself and 

    cephalophore you lose your head
    only to start running
    blind again into the dark
    i can't help but love that about you

    i think i tricked myself again
    i'm happy when i'm running 
    you're climbing up the tallest hill 
    but you don't know where you're going

    i know i should find love below
    but there's something chasing
    me away from inside

    <!-- but what's so wrong with coughing -->

    you love it
    you fill my head with little
    moments
    i know it
    it's better just to walk away
    i think they're mine but they're talking to me
    
    <!-- you're trying on somebody else
    just like your friends are costumes -->

    <!-- you just kept mirroring yourself
    waiting to be wanted -->

    *chanting chorus underneath*

    <!-- i shut it off again i
    i've been drinking lately
    mastering holding in/ my breath
    i do it like it's nothing

    he loves it
    he likes to know your words are rare
    but they're not
    it's just a waste and you don't care

    like a tap i guess i
    i try to fill my spaces -->

    <!-- if it just runs out my ribs
    then it's really not worth the trip
    but if it catches in my throat then maybe
    if you just run outta my ribs
    then it's really not worth a sip
    but if i catch it before it goes then maybe -->

    i really thought that
    you would know better
    i guess that's just the cost of being
    such a good pretender

    la da da da
    you fool yourself so easi-
    ly it's painful
    you can't even 

    just because you give up
    doesn't mean you're not enough
    just because you won't risk the moment
    just because you give up
    doesn't mean you're not enough
    just because you won't risk the moment
