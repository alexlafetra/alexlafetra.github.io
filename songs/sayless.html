    i am still there<br>
    even though i'm in my bed<br>
    you hold my arm in the city cvs
</p>
<p class = "verse">
    my baby<br>
    squeezes delicately<br>
    look out for the strings that broke/ when we held too tightly<br>
    mmm<br>
    oh hello<br>
    i think i've been here before<br>
    i feel like cgi<br>
    i feel like something undone<br>
    i'm still best friends with dead ends<br>
    so just<br>
    hit me up, if you still wanna pretend<br>
</p>
<p class = "verse">
    i'm just<br>
    holding on<br>
    delicately<br>
    you know the string broke<br>
    last time i held too tightly<br>
    i'm just<br>
</p>
<p class = "chorus">
    please just<br>
    lie to me<br> 
    i couldn't fake it if i tried<br>
    I break away so naturally<br>
    i couldn't fake it if i tried<br>
</p>
<p class = "notes">
    how this feels<br>
    i am still recalling<br>
    all i remember is the night<br>
    i forget how to breathe<br>

    let's dance<br>
    behind the curtain<br>
    looks like they're coming for us next<br>
    so just, please hold me down so i can get this off my chest<br>
</p>
<p>
    you held your body into the fire but you
    didn't watch it burn you just forgot it was there
    you always say that the good things are coming but
    baby don't wait for what you want to be there
</p>
<p class = "verse">
    i called you but<br>
    you didn't answer you just<br>
    let it ring<br>
    while you thought about your life<br>
    <br>
    how it can feel like<br>
    everyone leaves you<br>
    after saying i couldn't fake it if i tried<br>
</p>
<p class = "notes">
    i kind of feel like it should be in the third person to emphasize that it’s like a cautionary tale
    kind of like “leash called love”: *he’s* got *you* on a leash called love instead of you’ve got me or i’ve got you
</p>
<p class ="verse">
    please don’t lie to me<br>
    i couldn’t fake it if i tried<br>
    you’re gonna waste, all that honesty<br>
    i know you couldn't fake it if you tried<br>
