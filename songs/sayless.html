    i am still there<br>
    even though i'm in my bed<br>
    you hold my arm in the city cvs
</p>
<p class = "verse">
    just<br>
    holding on<br>
    delicately, you felt the<br>
    string break as you held too tightly<br>
    oh shit<br>
    i ran out in the morning with my head against the bus<br>
</p>
<p class = "chorus">
    please just<br>
    lean on me<br>
    i couldn't fake it if i tried<br>
    <br>
    i break away so naturally<br>
    i couldn't fake it if i tried<br>
</p>
<p class = "notes">
    how this feels<br>
    i don't stop to breathe<br>
    nahhhhi'm only softly crying<br>
    through the side of your cheek<br>
    i'm<br>
    staring at the curtain<br>
    that's falling on us next<br>
    and i said<br>
    please hold me down so i can get this off my chest<br>
</p>
<p class = "verse">
    
    you're falling short<br>
    but you've been giving it your best<br>
    just hold me down so i can get this off my chest<br>
</p>
<p class = "verse">
    i called you but<br>
    you didn't answer you just<br>
    let it ring<br>
    while you thought about your life<br>
    <br>
    how it can feel like<br>
    everyone leaves you<br>
    after saying "i couldn't fake it if i tried"<br>
</p>
<p class = "notes">
    i kind of feel like it should be in the third person to emphasize that it’s like a cautionary tale
    kind of like “leash called love”: *he’s* got *you* on a leash called love instead of you’ve got me or i’ve got you
</p>
<p class ="verse">
    please don’t lie to me<br>
    i couldn’t fake it if i tried<br>
    you’re only gonna waste your honesty<br>
    baby<br>
    she couldn’t fake it if she tried<br>
