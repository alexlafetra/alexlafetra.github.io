    <!-- i want to write about how i feel about zella
    how i wish i could've done something to make her happy, or feel better, or love her life more
    and how it hurt so bad baby to see you like that
    it really scared me, and made me feel alone like you weren't worried but i was

    people that love each other but can't take care of one another

     this feels like i'm pointing out some flaw
    or offering some critique of who you are

     kind of feeling inspired by grace ives and "natasha" by rufus wainwright
    you didn't always let zella in, also. Idk how much that could have changed things, but you didn't invite her to the land and you were so stressed about her being at your bday. Your birthday turned out really fun.

    I guess in some ways you were hurt and wanted to have control over the extent of how you felt hurt. I don't know why you were hurt by her not being interested in what you were interested in, or hurt by her just wanting to stay in one place.

    I think it hurt because A) being alone can hurt and B) you're already kind of sensitive to being alone, or being forced into a situation where you feel like you can't escape feeling alone.

    i'm deleting these photos not because i want to forget, but because i know these pictures aren't really remembering. They're carefully selected, some of the best moments, some of them posed.
    I took them because i wanted to tell a story to myself in the future, and i needed that story to feel like things were working and that i was doing what i was supposed to be doing to make us happy.
    but things weren't working, i wasn't happy and i know you had to compromise on things you wanted too. so i'm deleting these because i want to delete that story that i kept telling myself about how i felt and how i should have been feeling.

    It's also so sad. I miss these moments, and i had fun sometimes. it doesn't mean that breaking up wasn't a decision i made after thinking about it for a long time.

 speaking 2 different alphabets

 she calls me on the cell phone baby
 i've been kinda alright i've been kinda alriiight

 letter in your head aw baby
 i've been trying to see it
 i've been trying to spell you

 i'm falling with my eyes closed
 lately it's been so easy to let
 and so hard to let go ii

 you're smiling on the ground thro it's an
 uncomfortable thing to not say anything

 it's like i'm underwater

 you call me on antennae it's obvious but I don't see it coming
 you've

 i'm still under water
 

 it's got me on a leash aw baby
 i've been trying to cut it
 i've been trying just to close it

 two hits into my chest oh honey
 won't you run me down
 won't you run me down

 you're walking in your dreams
 away from the world
 i want you to stay but

 it's like we're under water (deep voice)
 and i can't hear your voice i just
 see the air wash
 up to the surface
 baby if i could catch it
 and bring it back to you

 you walk lightly on the cord baby
 like light in the cable
 you follow the road to the tv tv
 don't you understand
 my green bean that


 i lay on the floor now maybe i'm just trying to feel it
 trying to feel it
