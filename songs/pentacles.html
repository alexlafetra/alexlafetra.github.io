tryna catch a train

oh no you go too far
i've gone too fast
baby i can't really stop 

i'm saying
everything
goes up when
i feel it coming down

cheap call didn't 

i look at you babe
but 
i'm standing at the edge
i buy a ticket for your train just to feel it graze my cheek

just let it
simmer down
