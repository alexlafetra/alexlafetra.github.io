hold me then
against the car
i'm gun shy baby
i can play a part



i'm still trying
to catch you there
i'm gun shy baby
hanging onto the stairs

don't cough
<!-- find you in a warm place as i'm waking up -->

gun shy heart
but trigger happy head

tryna catch a train

oh love you go too far
i've gone too fast
imma crash the car
i'll refund all my time i
i'm coming for my time

i'm saying
everything
goes up when
i wanna let it down

cheap car will put you there 
i'm
ten toes and always scared

i look at you babe 
but 
i'm standing at the edge
buying tickets for your train just to feel it graze my nose

just let it
simmer down

oh babe
you go too far
got my head on ice
and my mouth on fiiire
i blow a little smoke
