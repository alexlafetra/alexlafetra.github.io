don't give me the flashlight
i'm not looking

no such thing as
-- cheap loving

hey baby
where's all my common sense
just

blade down your spiiaaane

half-lidded

keep coming
running hands along the surface always
looking for somethin
is there a way to tell what's inside

loving baby
gotta knife tatted on your spine
feeling
sharp lately
anyone who touches you is gonna feel
theeeeeeeee

i'm gettin a flashlight
warm glow to image the insides
it's spelled out in breaklights
overpass i think i'm gonna last

only
burnt for a moment
smoke turning from the head of a match just
strike it once and then blow it
just enough to help the city catch
