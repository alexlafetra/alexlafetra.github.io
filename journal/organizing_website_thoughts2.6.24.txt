okay, so thinking about the stepchild site, i want it to be a fun mix of explorable/informative so it's engaging and gives a sense of the playfullness of the stepchild. 

the INFO page should have:

a technical/faq/quick specs column
a nice technical drawing
a bit of background about how the stepchild came to be
